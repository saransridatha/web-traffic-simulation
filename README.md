### Web Traffic Simulation
This project is a Go-based tool for simulating high levels of web traffic to test how your web infrastructure handles a large number of concurrent HTTP requests. It provides real-time feedback on success/failure rates, response times, and other performance metrics during the load test. The tool is useful for stress testing your website or web application.
